### 🖥️ Self-Taught Developer and Passionate Programmer

I've always been fascinated by technology and software development, which has led me to explore, learn, and sharpen my skills independently. Over my career, I've had the opportunity to work on innovative projects, especially within the banking payments sector and automated payment systems.

- 💳 **Experience in Payment Solutions**: I've developed systems that enable credit card payment processing and have integrated devices in high-traffic environments, like airports, enhancing the user experience for vending machines and other self-service points.
  
### 🚀 Exploring the World of DevOps

Currently, I’m specializing in **DevOps**, where I'm delving into advanced services for managing productive environments through:
- **Containerization with Docker**: Designing and optimizing Docker containers for complex applications.
- **Microservices**: Developing and deploying distributed services.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrating containers and deploying applications across scalable clusters.
- **Serverless**: Exploring and deploying serverless applications with IBM Cloud Code Engine and other platforms.

### 🌐 Exercises and Projects on GitHub

In this repository, I share my progress and resolved exercises in container technologies, Kubernetes, and Python-based applications using Django and Flask, which are available for anyone interested in deepening their understanding of these tools.
